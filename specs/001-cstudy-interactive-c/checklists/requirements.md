# Specification Quality Checklist: CStudy - Interactive C Programming Learning Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025年10月15日
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (learning platform with automated grading) and WHY (immediate feedback, progress tracking, AI assistance)
- Written in plain language describing user experiences and business outcomes
- No mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation details in requirements or success criteria
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 50 functional requirements are specific, actionable, and testable
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts) without implementation details
- 27 acceptance scenarios cover primary user flows across 4 prioritized user stories
- 9 edge cases identified covering timeouts, encoding, permissions, and error conditions
- Scope clearly bounded to C programming learning with automated grading and AI assistance
- 10 assumptions documented covering user environment, dependencies, and usage patterns

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each functional requirement group (Exercise Management, Automated Grading, Batch Verification, User Interface, AI Assistance, System Requirements) maps to user scenarios
- User stories prioritized (P1-P4) with independent test criteria
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-012) are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No implementation leakage detected in specification language
